## About

I made this web application to practice using Styled Components and React Hooks. I wanted to deepen my understanding of hooks especially useEffect. I also hidden my api key by utilizing Netlify Functions. All css code is made by me except the heart loader. Designs are inspired from current famous synonym sites.

The api can only handle 1000 requests per day because that is the limit of the Merriam-Webster dictionary API. I might create my own api in the future to remove this limitation if the need arise.
