## About

I made this web application to practice using Styled Components and React Hooks. I wanted to deepen my understanding of hooks especially useEffect. I also hidden my api key by utilizing Netlify Functions. All css code is made by me except the heart loader. Designs are inspired from current famous synonym sites.

The api can only handle 1000 requests so I will keep this as a personal project. I might update the source so that I can practice SEO and make the app public.
